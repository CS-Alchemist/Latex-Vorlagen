\textit{\enquote{Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable
end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two
million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet
whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they
still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.}}
